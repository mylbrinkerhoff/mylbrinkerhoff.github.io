My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language, and phonetics, the study of sound. My research also probes questions concerning phonology's interfaces to other components of grammar, such as phonetics, morphology, and syntax. 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate and the Acting Phonetics Lab Manager with the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.

<!-- My advisor is [Grant McGuire](https://people.ucsc.edu/~gmcguir1/). I was also advised by [Junko Ito](https://people.ucsc.edu/~ito/index.html) prior to her retirement. -->

<!-- Before coming to Santa Cruz in 2019, I was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I received a Master's degree in Linguistics. My Masters thesis was *["On Subcategorization and PRIORITY: Evidence from Welsh Allomorphy"](https://doi.org/10.17615/td9g-v269)* which was advised by [Jennifer L. Smith](https://users.castle.unc.edu/~jlsmith/) and explored the allomorphy of the Welsh definite article. -->

<!-- I am also an organizer for [WLMA](https://wlma.ucsc.edu/) which is a reading group at the University of California, Santa Cruz dedicated to to discussing topics of shared interest relating to indigenous and understudied languages, with a special emphasis on the languages of Mesoamerica, which is currently on hiatus.   -->
