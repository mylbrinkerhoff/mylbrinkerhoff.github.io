I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Prior to coming to Santa Cruz in 2019, I was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I received a Master's degree in Linguistics. My Masters thesis was *["On Subcategorization and PRIORITY: Evidence from Welsh Allomorphy"](https://doi.org/10.17615/td9g-v269)* which was advised by [Jennifer L. Smith](https://users.castle.unc.edu/~jlsmith/).

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language. However, my current research is interested in questions concerning the phonology's interfaces to other areas in linguistics, especially the morphological and syntactic components.

Other areas that I focus on includes questions concerning the Celtic and Germanic languages from the Indo-European family and the Zapotecan languages spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico.

I collaborate with [Eirik Tengesdal](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/people/aca/scandinavian-languages/temporary/eirikten/) from *Universitetet i Oslo* on providing an analysis of pronominal object shift and its interaction with verbal particles and adverbs in Mainland Scandinavian. Additionally, I am conducting research for my first qualifying paper, with [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) as advisor, on the role that prosody plays in the shifting of negative indefinites in North Germanic languages.

I am a member of the [Zapotec Language Project](http://zapotec.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In conjunction with [Maya Wax Cavallaro](https://waxcavallaro.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [John (Jack) Duff](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jduff/), we am working on understanding the tonal system in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec and how it interacts with the syntax-prosody interface, word and sentence stress, and phonation. 

## Other Interests

I am an amatuer bookbinder and am always looking for ways to continue practicing this craft. 

I have also recently taken up crocheting again after a decade long hiatus.
