I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language, and syntax, the study of sentence structure. Additionally, my current research is interested in questions concerning phonology's interfaces to other components of grammar. My current advisor is [Grant McGuire](https://people.ucsc.edu/~gmcguir1/). Previously, I was advised by [Junko Ito](https://people.ucsc.edu/~ito/index.html) prior to her retirement. 

Prior to coming to Santa Cruz in 2019, I was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I received a Master's degree in Linguistics. My Masters thesis was *["On Subcategorization and PRIORITY: Evidence from Welsh Allomorphy"](https://doi.org/10.17615/td9g-v269)* which was advised by [Jennifer L. Smith](https://users.castle.unc.edu/~jlsmith/) and explored the allomorphy of the Welsh definite article.

 See [Research](/research/) for a more detailed description of my research.

 I am also a co-organizer for [WLMA](https://wlma.ucsc.edu/) (with [Maya Wax Cavallaro](https://waxcavallaro.sites.ucsc.edu/)), which is a reading group dedicated to linguistic fieldwork in Mesoamerica.
