I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language, and phonetics, the study of sound. Additionally, my research also probes questions concerning phonology's interfaces to other components of grammar such as phonetics, morphology, and syntax. My advisor is [Grant McGuire](https://people.ucsc.edu/~gmcguir1/). I was also advised by [Junko Ito](https://people.ucsc.edu/~ito/index.html) prior to her retirement.

Before coming to Santa Cruz in 2019, I was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I received a Master's degree in Linguistics. My Masters thesis was *["On Subcategorization and PRIORITY: Evidence from Welsh Allomorphy"](https://doi.org/10.17615/td9g-v269)* which was advised by [Jennifer L. Smith](https://users.castle.unc.edu/~jlsmith/) and explored the allomorphy of the Welsh definite article.

I am also an organizer for [WLMA](https://wlma.ucsc.edu/) which is a reading group at the University of California, Santa Cruz dedicated to to discussing topics of shared interest relating to indigenous and understudied languages, with a special emphasis on the languages of Mesoamerica, which is currently on hiatus.
