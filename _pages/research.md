My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language, and syntax, the study of sentence structure. Additionally, I am interested in linguistic fieldwork on the languages of Mesoamerica, in particular languages belonging to the Oto-Manguean language family. Other areas that I focus on includes questions concerning the Celtic and Germanic languages from the Indo-European family.

## Phonological interfaces

One of th major areas of my research is investigation the interaction of phonology with the other components of grammar. This includes how phonology influences (and is influenced by) phonetics, morphology, and syntax.

## Syntactic and Prosodic movement of pronominals

One area of particular interest is providing syntactic and phonological accounts for the displacement of pronominals. Two of the interesting cases involve pronominal Object Shift and Negatitive Indefintite Shifting in Scandinavian languages. I collaborated with [Eirik Tengesdal](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/people/aca/scandinavian-languages/temporary/eirikten/) from _Universitetet i Oslo_ on providing an analysis of pronominal object shift and its interaction with verbal particles and adverbs in Mainland Scandinavian.

## Santiago Laxopa Zapotec

I am a member of the [Zapotec Language Project](http://zapotec.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In conjunction with [Maya Wax Cavallaro](https://waxcavallaro.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [John (Jack) Duff](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jduff/), we are working on understanding the tonal system in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec and how it interacts with the syntax-prosody interface, word and sentence stress, and phonation.
