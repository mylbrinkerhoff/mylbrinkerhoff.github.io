## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on phonology, the study of sound-structure systems in language. However, my current research is interested in questions concerning the phonology's interfaces to other areas in linguistics, especially the morphological and syntactic components.

Other areas that I focus on includes questions concerning the Celtic and Germanic languages from the Indo-European family and the Zapotecan languages spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico.

I collaborate with [Eirik Tengesdal](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/people/aca/scandinavian-languages/temporary/eirikten/) from *Universitetet i Oslo* on providing an analysis of pronominal object shift and its interaction with verbal particles and adverbs in Mainland Scandinavian. Additionally, I am conducting research for my first qualifying paper, with [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) as advisor, on the role that prosody plays in the shifting of negative indefinites in North Germanic languages.

I am a member of the [Zapotec Language Project](http://zapotec.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In conjunction with [Maya Wax Cavallaro](https://waxcavallaro.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [John (Jack) Duff](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jduff/), we am working on understanding the tonal system in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec and how it interacts with the syntax-prosody interface, word and sentence stress, and phonation.
