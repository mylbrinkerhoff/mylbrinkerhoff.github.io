excerpt: 'This paper is about providing an account of Norwegian object shift within Match Theory. We show that Match Theory is well suited to account for the shifting of pronominal objects if the MATCH constraints are sensitive to lexical elements only. This observation is in contrast with the findings from Elfner (2012) that MATCH should be sensitive to both lexical and functional elements.'

One significant contribution of generative linguistics has been to our understanding of 'movement,' which occurs when a word is linearized in a position different from where it is interpreted. Even though movement often is considered a syntactic phenomenon, some cases seem best analyzed prosodically, such as pronoun post-posing in Irish (Bennett, Elfner, & McClosky 2016). We explore prosodically driven movement in Norwegian, which is known for having pronominal object shift (OS). We show that OS can be explained by Match Theory (Selkirk 2009, 2011), but only if the Match constraints are sensitive to lexical items and their projections instead of Elfner's (2012) definition where Match is sensitive to lexical and functional elements and their projections.
