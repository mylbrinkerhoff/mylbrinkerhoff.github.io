Teaching Fellow and instructor of record for Introduction to Language (LING 101). It was my responsibility to teach lectures, design lessons, homeworks, and exams, and to hold office hours where students were able to ask questions and practice. This was for both Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters.
