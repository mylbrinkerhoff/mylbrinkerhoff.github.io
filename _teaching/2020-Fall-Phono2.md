Teaching Assistent for Phonology II under supervision from Ryan Bennett, Professor of Linguistics. It was my responsibility to teach two sections per week, that were taken in conjunction with the main lecture, and hold office hours where students were able to ask questions and practice what they learned in the main lecture. Additionally, I was tasked with grading homeworks and exams.
