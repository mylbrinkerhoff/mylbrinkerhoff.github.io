Teaching Assistent for Introduction to Language (LING 101) under supervision from Jules M. Terry, Professor of Linguistics. It was my responsibility to teach one section, that was taken in conjunction with the main lecture, and hold office hours where students were able to ask questions and practice what they learned in the main lecture. Additionally, I was tasked with grading homeworks and exams.
